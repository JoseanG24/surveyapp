# surveyapp
A solo project made by me during an internship program

the technologies used are React JS, Node JS and SQL SERVER

This project consist of two applications. The first one being the administrator one, where the only the administrator type user can access. In there this user can see
all the data recolected from the different surveys made, as well as the information used for those surveys (like tasks, users, etc.)

Then there is the client app which is the survey itself. If there is an active survey (which only the administrator can activate or deactivate) the user, that in this
case will be a worker at an x company, will be completing his/hers daily tasks and timing them by pressing them on the application. 

The data collected is then used to perform an activity-based costing (ABC) analysis.
